# Final-Research-Project

### Abstract
This research project explores artificial intelligence methodologies to evaluate and compare machine learning models using a structured approach. The notebook facilitates a streamlined process, including dataset preparation, model comparison, analysis of results, and prediction generation. The goal is to identify the most effective model for a red wine dataset and provide actionable insights based on its performance metrics. The project includes detailed steps for model evaluation and enables saving trained models for future use.
